SMail Archiver is a python script that can be used to backup an email account
It uses the pycrypto library and requires python 2.7 or above.
python 3.x does not work yet but this should be fixed in further release

Backup:
    The emails are fetch using IMAP. UID of emails are used to identify emails.
    Each mail is saved in {user}/{uid}.mbox.
    Running the command several time won't overwrite the files, existing mbox
    file are ignored.

Restore:
    When restoring a backup, the script read the content of the specified backup
    folder and, for each .mbox file, decrypt it and store the result in a unique
    mbox file using the format {foldername}.mbox, overwritting potential
    previous restoration.
    
    .mbox files present in the folder but not part of the backup are likely to
    make the program crash. Other type of files are ignored.
    
Security:
    The script uses AES256 in CBC mode for encryption and HMAC-SHA256 for 
    signature. The size of the AES key can be changed with the variable 
    AES_KEY_SIZE (16, 24, 32). Use a different algorithms is not proposed as
    requires more change in the code.
    
    Two possibles mode of security are possible : simple or password protected.
    In simple mode (the variable {promp} is not set), no password from the user
    is required, the two (AES and HMAC) keys are generated using a PRNG and are
    the secret. The generated file SHOULD be protected in a secure way.
    In password protected mode (the variable {promp} is true), a password is
    asked and the two keys are generated using this password and random salt
    using PBKDF2. The generated file contains the salt and should no longer be
    protected. However, the strength of the encryption lies in the strength of 
    the password and it could be an additionnal protection to protect the salt
    file in case of weak password.

Usage:
    usage: smailarchiver [-h] [-u USER] [-i IMAP] [-p PASSWD] [-f FOLDER]
                         [-k KEYS] [-P] [-c CONFIG] [-d DECRYPT] [--verbose]
                         [--version]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -u USER, --user USER  email username
      -i IMAP, --imap IMAP  IMAP email server
      -p PASSWD, --passwd PASSWD
                            email password
      -f FOLDER, --folder FOLDER
                            inbox folder name
      -k KEYS, --keys KEYS  key/salt file
      -P, --promp           promp for password of keys
      -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                            JSON file containing a list of configuration
      -d DECRYPT, --decrypt DECRYPT
                            decrypt a folder containing encypted mbox
      --verbose             verbose mode
      --version             show program's version number and exit

    The optional -c CONGIF use a JSON file containing the configuration (useful
    for cronjob for instance). It can contains the configuration for several 
    mail accounts. An example of the format used is present in 
    config.json.example.

    The option -d DECRYPT requires the name of the folder containing the backup
    files. The restored emails will be stored in the {DECRYPT}.mbox file.
