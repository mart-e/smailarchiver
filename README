SMail Archiver is a python script that can be used to backup an email account
It uses the pycrypto library and requires python 2.7 or above.

Backup:
    The emails are fetch using IMAP. UID of emails are used to identify emails.
    Each mail is saved in {user}/{uid}.mbox.
    If the option {compress} is used, the email will be compressed usign GZip
    and the result is saved in {user}/{uid}.gz.mbox.
    Running the command several time won't overwrite the files, existing mbox
    file are ignored.

Restore:
    When restoring a backup, the script read the content of the specified backup
    folder and, for each .mbox file, decrypt it and store the result in a unique
    mbox file using the format {foldername}.mbox, overwritting potential
    previous restoration.
    
    .mbox files present in the folder but not part of the backup are likely to
    make the program crash. If the extension is .gz.mbox, a GZip decompression
    is processed. Other type of files are ignored.
    
Security:
    The script uses AES256 in CBC mode for encryption and HMAC-SHA256 for 
    signature. The size of the AES key can be changed with the variable 
    AES_KEY_SIZE (16, 24, 32). Use a different algorithms is not proposed as
    requires more change in the code.
    
    Two possibles mode of security are possible : simple or password protected.
    In simple mode (the variable {promp} is not set), no password from the user
    is required, the two (AES and HMAC) keys are generated using a PRNG and are
    the secret. The generated file SHOULD be protected in a secure way.
    In password protected mode (the variable {promp} is true), a password is
    asked and the two keys are generated using this password and random salt
    using PBKDF2. The generated file contains the salt and should no longer be
    protected. However, the strength of the encryption lies in the strength of 
    the password and it could be an additionnal protection to protect the salt
    file in case of weak password.

Usage:
    usage: smailarchiver [-h] [-u USER] [-i IMAP] [-p PASSWD] [-f FOLDER]
                         [-k KEYS] [-P] [-c CONFIG] [-d DECRYPT] [-z] [--verbose]
                         [--version]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -u USER, --user USER  email username
      -i IMAP, --imap IMAP  IMAP email server
      -p PASSWD, --passwd PASSWD
                            email password
      -f FOLDER, --folder FOLDER
                            inbox folder name
      -k KEYS, --keys KEYS  key/salt file
      -P, --promp           promp for password of keys
      -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                            JSON file containing a list of configuration
      -d DECRYPT, --decrypt DECRYPT
                            decrypt a folder containing encypted mbox
      -z, --compress        Compress the mail data before encrypting
      --verbose             verbose mode
      --version             show program's version number and exit
    
    The optional -c CONGIF use a JSON file containing the configuration (useful
    for cronjob for instance). It can contains the configuration for several 
    mail accounts. An example of the format used is present in 
    config.json.example.

    The option -d DECRYPT requires the name of the folder containing the backup
    files. The restored emails will be stored in the {DECRYPT}.mbox file.

IMAP folder:
    The saved folder is specified in the variable {folder}. By default "INBOX"
    is used which should be available on many emails provider.
    
    In the case of Gmail, all emails can be saved easily using the name 
    '"[Gmail]/All Mail"'. Note that this name can be change depending of the
    language of your email account or not available in IMAP. Read the following
    page for more information :
    http://www.sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=gmail_archiver
    
    When using a folder name with spaces (like in the Gmail example above), you
    may need to double-quote the name ('"folder name"' or "'folder name'") in
    Python 3.x

    To know which IMAP folders are available, open a python promp and use the 
    following code :

    >>> import imaplib
    >>> m = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL("imap.bar.com")
    >>> m.login("foo@bar.com","mypasword")
    ('OK', [b'Logged in'])
    >>> m.list()
    ('OK', [b'(\\HasNoChildren) "." "Junk"', b'(\\HasNoChildren) "." "Trash"', b
    '(\\HasNoChildren) "." "Drafts"', b'(\\HasNoChildren) "." "Sent"', b'(\\HasN
    oChildren) "." "INBOX"'])

    (or `m.list("foldername")` for the subfolders)
    
    You can specify only one IMAP folder per configuration. However, you can
    configure several sites for the same email account in the the config.json
    file. Note that the destination folder is specified using the {user} 
    variable and emails from the same account will be merged. Emails are
    identified with UID which are unique per message. Emails with the same UID
    in the destination folder ({UID}.mbox or {UID}.gz.mbox) are skipped during
    the save process. At the decryption process, all emails in the folder will
    be merged in a {user}.mbox file.
